1. What is Selenium? What are the different Selenium components? Explain about Selenium Webdriver.
     Selenium is an automation testing tool used to test web-based applications.
     WebDriver is a collection of open source APIs which are used to automate the testing of a web application. 
     There are four components of Selenium 
     Selenium IDE, RC, WebDriver, and Grid. 
     Selenium Webdriver is a successor to selenium RC.
     Selenium webdriver accepts commands and sends them to a browser.
     It does not need a special server to execute tests.

2. How does Selenium communicate with the Web browsers?
     Selenium WebDriver is a browser automation framework that accepts commands and sends them to a browser.
        for each Selenium command, a HTTP request(JASAON WIRE PROTOCAL  creates a HTTP request by conerting selenium command inti Url link)
        is created and sent to the browser driver,
	the browser driver uses a HTTP server for getting the HTTP requests,
	the HTTP server determines the steps needed for implementing the Selenium command,the implementation steps are executed on the browser.
	the execution status is sent back to the HTTP server.
	the HTTP server sends the status back to the automation script.  

3.What are the locators available  to find an element using Selenium?
    -By ID
    -By name
    -By classname
    -By tag name
    -By linkText
    -By partial link text
    -By CSS
    -By Xpath 

4. Why ID is preferable than X-Path?

    ID is considered as unique key so there cannot be more than 1 elements for same ID.
    Xpath is created using relative path/position of elements,
    so there can be cases when we can get 2 or more elements for same Xpath.
    so it takes a lot of time compared to ID.

5.How to select value in dropdown?
    
    There are three methods in dropdown, 
     selectByVisibleText(string args)
     selectByValue(string args)
     selectByIndex(string args)

    To select the value in dropdown,
      WebElement date =driver.findElement(By.id("day"));
      Select d=new Select(date);
      dd1.selectByValue("23");

6) What is the difference between Absolute Path and Relative Path?
   
   Absolute path:It specifies the location from the root directory.
   Relative path:It is related to the current directory.
   
7) How to verify if the given check box is checked or not (it is not taught but you can explore) Try here: http://leafground.com/pages/checkbox.html
     
     We can used the isSelected() method over the checkbox element. 
     The isSelected() method returns a boolean value of true if the checkbox is checked false otherwise
  
8)Difference between System.setProperty and WebDriverManager
     -WebDriverManager-- is an API that allows users to automate the handling of driver executables like chromedriver.exe
      WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
      It checks the version of the browser and driver.
     -System.setProperty 
      method to used to set its path.
      System.setProperty("webdriver.chrome.driver", "/absolute/path/to/binary/chromedriver");

9) Write the syntax for preceding and following x-paths.
     Elder cousin xpath//following::Younger cousin tagname[index]
     Younger cousing xpath//preceding::tagname

10) How to get an attribute value using Selenium WebDriver?
     WebDriverManager.chromedriver().setup();
     ChromeDriver driver=new ChromeDriver();
     driver.get("https://www.facebook.com/");
